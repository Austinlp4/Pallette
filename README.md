Palette is an art social media hub. Artists of all mediums (As long as that medium uses color), can practice using a specified color palette which changes every week and submit their work to be contested against the work of others. The community decides three winners (The top three highest amounts of likes for the specified Palette of the Week) and each winning work will recieve either a gold, silver, or bronze ribbon. Enjoy!
